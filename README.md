# Image-to-Text Extraction Using CNN

This project demonstrates a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for **image-to-text extraction**. The model is trained to classify images into predefined text labels using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## Features:
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes images and converts them to grayscale for text recognition.
- **CNN Model**: Uses convolutional layers to extract features and classify images.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots for model accuracy and loss, and displays some predictions.
  
## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dinkarr/Image-To-Text
